# Contribution
Roxas2099, the person who wanted this mod created, has suggested that the following models could be added
Time Force Pink Ranger for Ann
Ninja Storm Navy Blue for Yusuke
Ranger Slayer for Haru
Psycho Red for Akechi
RPM Silver Ranger for Kasumi 

DM them for models, as they have all the ones you'd need
If you add all of these, feel free to create a mod on GameBanana. I only ask that Roxas be put down for coming up with the concept and me (BobbyTheCatfish) as the modeler for what I added.
